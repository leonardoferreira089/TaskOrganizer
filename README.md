# Task-Organizer LF089

This is Asp.Net core MVC project developed and hosted for practice and professional improvements.
The Task Organizer System was Developed by Leonardo Ferreira to practice creating small registration screen systems. This is a system designed to:
* Manage learning;
* Listing Courses;
* Desired Books with image upload.

all these properties make the study journey more organized. The System is developed with the C# language, using the ASP.NET Core framework created by Microsoft. Still constantly improving, the system uses the design pattern MVC to decouple user-interface (View), data (Model), and application logic (Controller). This pattern helps to achieve separation of concerns. In addition, the database has been integrated with the powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mappers) EntityFramework to aid in productivity.

The Deploy of the project was realeased with the powerful Microsoft Azure and you can access it [here](https://task-organizer.azurewebsites.net).
